      "\n",
      "* Live sessions for coding instructions\n",
      "* Step-by-step coding examples\n",
      "* A final project where students will build an end-to-end system from scratch\n",
      "* Lifetime access to past and future cohorts, allowing students to continue learning without interruption\n",

      "However, the document does mention that \"You should set aside a minimum of 4 hours/week during the three weeks of the program\" if you are attending live sessions. But this is not a guarantee or an obligation, and it's up to individual preferences.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: Is there a program certificate upon completion?\n",
      "Answer: I don't know. The question is not directly asked in the provided document, but it can be inferred that since Santiago is referred to as the instructor of the program, and he mentions providing certificates for each cohort, it's likely that they do provide a certificate of completion upon graduation from the program.\n",
